*Project Description*
{project:description}

Researchers in the University of Oxford, Dublin City University, University of California San Diego, Auckland University of Technology, and University of Melbourne have extended the original SenseCam browser. It is recommended that all Autographer and SenseCam researchers use this browser.

Advantages of this browser:
* Multi-user functionality - useful for researchers managing data from multiple subjects
* Easy labelling/annotation of events
* Event segmentation - option to automatically summarise thousands of images into a small number of events e.g. 2,000 images on average segmented into ~20 events
* Platform for future applications - backend database allows for easy extension of this browser for applications to suit your research purposes
